Maximize impact by focussing relentlessly on highest point of contribution.

> Essentialism is a disciplined, systematic approach for determining where our highest point of contribution lies, then making execution of those things almost effortless

> Essentialism is not about how to get more things done; it’s about **how to get the right things done**. It doesn’t mean just doing less for the sake of less either. It is about making the **wisest possible investment of your time and energy in order to operate at our highest point of contribution** by doing only what is essential.
