[Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nest_egg):
> A natural or artificial egg placed in a bird's nest, to encourage the bird to lay its own eggs there.

Where you put down one idea, others will crop up. To be able to do so, you have to [[Writing is Thinking|write down your ideas]], your nest eggs.

Learned this from [Austin Kleon, quoting Thoreau](https://austinkleon.com/2018/01/22/thoughts-as-nest-eggs/):
> Each thought that is welcomed and recorded is a nest egg, by the side of which more will be laid.
