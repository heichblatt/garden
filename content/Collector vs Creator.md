> Many note-takers hoard content because it gives them an illusion of knowledge.

Better:

> **Collect**. Note-taking, raw snippets, Kindle highlights + personal commentary. <br/>
> **Connect**. Link to previous notes. Do not keep orphan notes.<br/>
> **Create**. [[Think in Public|Write original articles]].
