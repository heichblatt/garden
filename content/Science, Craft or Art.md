All professions and to a lesser extent most [[Productivity|human activity]] can be classified as either science, craft or art. Every profession will always share in the other two but be mainly located in one category.

For example, IT infrastructure engineering is a craft. It takes its base from several sciences and at times has creative elements bordering on art but at its core it remains a craft.
