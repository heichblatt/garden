Common trichotomy of styles in editing [[Topological vs Chronological|topologically structured content]], e.g. [[Digital Garden|digital gardens]].

> three main note-taking styles:
> **The architect.** They enjoy planning, designing processes and frameworks, and need a note-taking tool that allows them to easily structure their ideas.
> **The gardener.** They enjoy exploring, connecting various thoughts together, and need a note-taking tool that allows them to easily grow their ideas.
> **The librarian.** They enjoy collecting, building a catalogue of resources, and need a note-taking tool that allows them to easily retrieve their ideas.

She quoted G.R.R. Martin:

> I think there are two types of writers, the architects and the gardeners. The architects plan everything ahead of time, like an architect building a house. They know how many rooms are going to be in the house, what kind of roof they’re going to have, where the wires are going to run, what kind of plumbing there’s going to be. They have the whole thing designed and blueprinted out before they even nail the first board up. The gardeners dig a hole, drop in a [[Seeds, Trees and Fruits|seed]] and water it. They kind of know what seed it is, they know if planted a fantasy seed or mystery seed or whatever. But as the plant comes up and they water it, they don’t know how many branches it’s going to have, they find out as it grows. And I’m much more a gardener than an architect.
