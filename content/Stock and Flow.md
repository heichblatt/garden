[Robin Sloan: Stock and Flow](https://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890/#what)

> **Flow is the feed**. It’s the posts and the tweets. It’s the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that reminds people you exist.
> **Stock is the durable stuff**. It’s the content you produce that’s as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It’s what people discover via search. It’s what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time.

> And the real magic trick is to put them both together. To keep the ball bouncing with your flow—to maintain that open channel of communication—while you work on some kick-ass stock in the background. Sacrifice neither. The hybrid strategy.

> Today, whenever I put my hands on the keyboard, I’m asking myself: Is this stock? Is this flow? How’s my mix? Do I have enough of both?
