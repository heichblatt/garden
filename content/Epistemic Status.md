epistemic-status: budding
---

All notes in the garden are tagged with an epistemic status. The status is a rough indicator of the note's maturity.

I use [Maggie Appleton's system](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history):

> - ğŸŒ±Â _Seedlings_Â for very rough and early ideas <br>
> - ğŸŒ¿Â _Budding_Â for work I've cleaned up and clarified <br>
> - ğŸŒ³Â _Evergreen_Â for work that is reasonably complete (though I still tend these over time).

Similar to [[Seeds, Trees and Fruits]].
