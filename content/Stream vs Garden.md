[Mike Caulfield: The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)

- Caufield argued that the dominant mode of online interaction had become the "stream," exemplified by platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and email inboxes.
- These streams present information as a **single, time-ordered path**, emphasizing the immediacy and self-assertion of individual utterances.
- While valuable for conversation and rhetoric, Caufield argued that the stream is **[[Consumption vs Creation|unsuited for accumulating knowledge]]** and building a deeper understanding of complex issues.

In contrast to the stream, Caufield proposed the "[[Digital Garden|garden]]" as a space for **cultivating personal knowledge over time**.

- Gardens are characterized by **richly interlinked information, arranged and rearranged to facilitate exploration and the discovery of new connections**.
- Information in a garden is **timeless, iterative, and integrative**, allowing for multiple perspectives and pathways through the material.
- Caufield saw the garden as a **counterbalance to the ephemerality of the stream**, a space where **knowledge can mature and deepen over time**.
