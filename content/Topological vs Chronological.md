A common dichotomy when talking about content structure.

The early internet was mostly ordered according to subject matter, following topics with hyperlinks, leading to a topological structure. People added to their personal website, mostly oriented around interests or other topics. [[Stock|Stock and Flow]] benefits from this structure, [[digital gardens|Digital Garden]] are a modern form of this.

Later on, blogging and social media led to a predominance of chronological organization. This has deeply influenced the modern web which is almost always organized in [[streams|Stock and Flow]]. Amy Hoy lamented this transition in [How the blog broke the web](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/). Maggie Appleton ([A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)) pointed to the quasi economic thinking underlying this
> we've moved away from casual live journal entries and formalised our writing into articles and essays. These are carefully crafted, edited, revised, and published with a timestamp. When it's done, it's done. We act like tiny magazines, sending our writing off to the printer.
> We have all been trained to behave like tiny, performative corporations when it comes to presenting ourselves in digital space. Blogging evolved in the Premium Mediocre culture of Millenialism as a way to Promote Your Personal Brandâ„¢ and market your SEO-optimized Content.

This is very similar to [[Stream vs Garden]] and [[Stock and Flow]].
